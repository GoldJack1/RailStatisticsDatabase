# Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

Your repository is now fully configured for Netlify deployment with Firebase integration.

### Automatic Configuration

The `netlify.toml` file includes all necessary configuration:

- ✅ **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- ✅ **Publish Directory**: `build`
- ✅ **Node Version**: 18
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: All Firebase config included
- ✅ **ESLint Disabled**: Prevents build failures
- ✅ **Redirects**: React Router support
- ✅ **Security Headers**: XSS protection, frame options, etc.

### 🔧 Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Select the repository: `GoldJack1/RailStatisticsDatabase`
3. Leave build settings as default (they're in netlify.toml)
4. Deploy!

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Deploy with Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
```

### 🔐 Environment Variables

All Firebase environment variables are configured in `netlify.toml`:

- `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

#### Build Fails
- Check Netlify build logs

#### Firebase Errors
